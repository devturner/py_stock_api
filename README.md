stock_api
=========
 A restful stock portfolio API that runs on python Pyramid and is hosted on AWS EC2.

 End goal: an app that consumes data from a 3rd party API and provides our users with the ability to create stock portfolios. Once we’ve built the basic functionality of the application, we’ll introduce data science, visualizations, and machine learning into the application so we can analyze and make basic predictions based on historical data!
